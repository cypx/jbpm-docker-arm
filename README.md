# ARM compatible JBPM Docker image

Docker image & docker compose file to run JBPM server on an ARM powered device (like Mac M1/M2).  
Inspired fron official JBoss image ( <https://quay.io/repository/kiegroup/jbpm-server-full> / <https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/business-central/> ) wich currently do not provide ARM build.
